    "The simplest and most common parallel pattern is to take a serial program and convert it into a parallel program.\n",

    "* My code’s not running fast enough:\n",
    "  * Video: data delays produce jitter, stalls\n",
    "  * Web: page render time causes user loss, discomfort\n",
    "  * Batch processing, indexing, analysis not completing in time \n",
    "  * High-throughput finance: other models running faster and beating mine to a decision -> lose arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "* This leads to a natural software engineering process\n",
    "  * Profile code: find out what’s slow\n",
    "  * Parallelize slow part(s) only\n",
    "  * Migrate from serial implementation to parallel implementation\n",
    "* It's  not the best process\n",
    "  * Serial to parallel doesn’t produce the best designs\n",
    "  * Best parallel implementation may require a totally different design with no incremental refatoring from serial implementation\n",
