    "## Loop Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is almost all by example in file [stencil.c](./openmp/omp_c/stencil.c) which demonstrates successive optimizations to a loop.  These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing a memory efficient loop iteration order\n",
    "  * xy or yx iteration order for 2-d array\n",
    "* Choose which loop to optimize\n",
    "  * Identify which loop produces adequate parallelism.\n",
    "  * This is more important in your homework than stencil.\n",
    "* Unroll loops to minimize branching inside loops\n",
    "  * How many instructions does this eliminate?\n",
    "* Fuse loops to reduce startup costs (shown in `array_sum`)\n",
    "* Seperate dependencies and use reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split loops"
