    "* Startup costs associated with initiating processes\n",
    "  * May often overwhelm actual processing time (rendering ||ism useless)\n",
    "  * Involve thread/process creation, data movement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interference: slowdown resulting from multiple processors accessing shared resources\n",
    "  * Resources: memory, I/O, system bus, sub-processors\n",
    "  * Software synchronization: locks, latches, mutex, barriers\n",
    "  * Hardware synchronization: cache faults, interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Skew: when breaking a single task into many smaller tasks, not all tasks may be the same size\n",
    "  * Not all tasks finish at the same time\n",
