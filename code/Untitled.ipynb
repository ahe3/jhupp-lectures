    "## Critical Sections: The Synchronization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to take a deeper look inside synchronization of threads/processes and the principles needed to share data safely. There are two typical goals:\n",
    "* Contention: \n",
    "  * How to resolve the conflicts that result from multiple processes trying to access shared resources?\n",
    "* Cooperation:\n",
    "  * An action by one process may enable another action by another process\n",
    "  * In such cases, processes should coordinate their actions\n",
    "  \n",
    "Maybe do the parable of buying milk to motivate why it is hard....... Or find a better example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization issues are the major bug in parallel programs\n",
    "* Deadlock: when a program cannot progress because all of it's threads/processes are waiting on resources.\n",
    "* Incorrect results: from uncontrolled sharing (race conditions) on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructs/algorithms underlying critical sections (locks, atomic variables) are complex.\n",
    "Understanding them will help you use them well.\n",

    "It guarantees\n",
    "  * Exclusive access to a shared resource among competing processes\n",
    "  * No deadlock\n",
