Lectures for Johns Hopkins University EN 601.(3/4/6)20 Parallel Programming , Spring 2019.  Course home page at https://parallel.cs.jhu.edu.

These are interactive lectures in which all code examples are runnable and graphs (as many as possible) are derived from interactive R code.  The intent is that the student will follow the lecture in the notebook in real time and can interact/engage with the code while learning.

Examples in this notebook are in Jupyter notebooks in different kernels (R, Python, Java, C++).  And some code examples must be run from a shell, which can be launched in Jupyter.
